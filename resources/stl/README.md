### STL files

This is a collection of 3D printable parts. 
Detailed print, build and usage examples are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/mav_hardware/wiki) under [Resources](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/mav_hardware/wiki/MAV-Hardware#resources).
If you need to edit the files you can view the assemblies online and dowload the full model in any format (e.g. as STEP files) by following the links under [Resources](https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/mav_hardware/wiki/MAV-Hardware#resources).
